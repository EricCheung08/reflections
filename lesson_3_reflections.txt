When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    After finishing some work, I want to save it into master.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be changes that need to be reviewed by others. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone is the make a copy of all the code. Fork is when Clone is done via git hub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This way you can do a diff to see the differece between the two, and also, you can take in as much changes as you can. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    If I don't have git or github, I would be sending files back and forth or saving it somewhere random. It would be much harder. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
